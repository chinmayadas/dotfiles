## Initial Setup and Installation

### Backup

First, you may want to backup any existing files that exist so this doesn't overwrite your work.

Run `install/backup.sh` to backup all symlinked files to a `~/dotfiles-backup` directory.

This will not delete any of these files, and the install scripts will not overwrite any
existing. After the backup is complete, you can delete the files from your home directory
to continue installation.

### Installation

If on OSX, you will need to install the XCode CLI tools before continuing. To do
so, open a terminal and type

```bash
âžœ xcode-select --install
```

### Fonts
To render prettier theme for vim, tmux, and terminal,
[Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) font will be installed to provide
"Powerline" glyphs.

### Vim

[Vim plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is used to manage vim plugins.

Switching to neovim (nvim)
